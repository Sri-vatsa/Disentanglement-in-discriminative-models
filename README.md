# Disentanglement-In-Discriminative-Models

_Course project for [CS 8803 LS](https://sites.google.com/view/cs8803ls-fa2021/)_

We improve generalizability of CNN-based vision models to downstream tasks by disentangling learned representation space dimensions.

Our motivation, approach and results can be found in this [course presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fLDYS5FN7OX5V8lBASvNkgFj9ex_s73U/view?usp=sharing).
